# Media delivery (local files)

## Model

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Resolve** | Token in chat / attachments → verified absolute path (session + project + grants) |
| **Deliver** | Absolute path → viewable URL for `<img>` / `<video>` / `fetch` |

## Delivery: loopback HTTP (primary)

Host starts a process-local axum server on a random available port in the
browser-safe dynamic/private range `127.0.0.1:49152-65535` at app boot
(`media_server.rs`). Do not bind `127.0.0.1:0`: hosts with a customized
ephemeral range can return Chromium-blocked service ports such as `3659`, and
WebView2 then rejects media with `ERR_UNSAFE_PORT` before the request reaches
the server.

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:{port}/v1/media?t={token}&p={urlencode(absPath)}
```

- **Token**: random per process; frontend loads via `media_server_endpoint` / `ensureMediaEndpoint()`.
- **path_scope**: same allowlist as fs absolute APIs (trusted projects, app data, agent home, grants).
- **Images**: no-Range GET returns **full 200 body** (up to 40 MiB). `<img>` cannot reassemble Range/206 — truncating at 2 MiB breaks chat thumbs and composer drops.
- **Range**: 206 + max 2 MiB chunk for video/audio/PDF (and Range requests on any type).
- **Rich document previews**: Office/PDF full-file renderers cap input at 40 MiB, validate every `Content-Range`, assemble into one bounded buffer, and abort fetches when the preview changes. Video/audio remain streamed rather than reassembled.
- **CORS**: main-window origins only (for `fetch` / copy / office reassembly); never `*`.
- **CSP**: `img-src` / `media-src` / `connect-src` allow `http://127.0.0.1:*`.

Frontend entry: `src/lib/imageSrc.ts` (`localPathToMediaHttpUrl`, `resolveImageSrc*`).  
Preview/office: `src/lib/filePreviewSrc.ts` (reassembles multi-Range for full-file readers).

## Chat image thumbs (performance)

Chat **card** layout does **not** re-stream full multi-MB originals on every virtual-list remount.

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Host | `media_image_thumb` → `{app_data}/cache/image-thumbs/{hash}.jpg` (≤480px edge, JPEG). Local key = path+mtime+size; remote https key = URL. |
| Frontend | `resolveChatImageThumb` / `ImageUi` card mode loads thumb via loopback media; lightbox still opens original path/URL. |
| HTTP | Image responses: `Cache-Control: private, max-age=604800` + weak ETag. |

Very small locals (≤96 KiB) may skip re-encode and serve the original path.  
Video covers remain separate (`video-posters` + ffmpeg).

## Image viewer lifecycle

Keep the shared viewer context and hooks in `ImageViewerContext.ts`, outside
the provider's Fast Refresh boundary. Opening, closing, or unmounting the
provider invalidates earlier asynchronous preparation; an older gallery must
not reopen after close or replace a newer gallery. After first use, keep the
lightbox mounted with `open=false` so its exit cleanup can complete.

The viewer accepts mixed image and video galleries. Local video slides use the
same loopback media endpoint as images; a gallery mounted during endpoint boot
must rerender after `ensureMediaEndpoint()` settles so it does not keep a raw
`file://` URL for the lifetime of the card. Image-only copy and zoom behavior
must not be attached to video elements.

Remote wallpaper cards open their already-validated thumbnail immediately and
materialize the original only when that slide becomes current. Keep at most two
original transfers active. If navigation outruns those slots, retain only the
latest waiting slide; revisiting it may schedule it again after a slot opens.
An original failure keeps the thumbnail visible, shows localized safe copy and
retries only after an explicit user action.

Closing the viewer, closing the source picker, changing source, starting a new
search, refreshing Grok Saved, or observing a Grok Saved page/account revision
invalidates queued and in-flight renderer results. A late original must neither
reopen/replace the current gallery nor restore selection or local-path state
from the previous source revision. Cancellation is still sent to the matching
Host media bridge so renderer rejection is not the only boundary.

## Fallback

`media://` custom protocol remains registered for cold-start races only. Steady-state UI should use HTTP URLs.

Full-file consumers that must construct a browser `Blob` / `File` may use the
bounded raw-IPC pair `media_file_info` + `media_read_file_chunk`. This avoids a
WebView2 local-network policy that can block page-script loopback `fetch()`
before the request reaches the Host CORS handler. Raw IPC reads still require
`path_scope`, return at most 8 MiB per chunk, and reject files over 200 MiB.
Wallpaper preview remains on loopback HTTP; only “apply” uses the full-file IPC
path.

## Security notes

- Bind **only** loopback.
- Never put filesystem paths in the path segment without token.
- Embedded browser webviews do **not** receive the token; they cannot read local media via this server.
- Do not reintroduce `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for media.

## Path citation (agent + UI)

| Kind | Agent should write | UI |
|------|--------------------|-----|
| Local media to preview | Real absolute path in **inline** backticks (real spaces, no shell `\ `) | ImageUi / VideoUi via loopback media |
| Project code/docs | Project-relative with **enough unique segments** (not bare `正文.md` / shared `04-正文/正文.md` when many exist) | FilePathCard; Host smart open + session path map (last-touch) |
| Web/CMS assets | Full `https://…` | URL card — never treat `/images/…` as local FS |

### How the agent must cite (product rule)

Host injects always-on **path citation** text into session `grok --rules` via `path_citation_session_rules` → `merge_extra_rules` (`official_aux.rs`). Soft guidance only, but the UI contract is hard:

1. **Inline backticks only** for clickable path cards: `` `path/to/file` ``.  
   Fenced blocks (```` ``` ```` / ```` ```text ````) stay plain `CodeBlock` — **not** FilePathCards. Do not put the only path handoff inside a fence.
2. **Not tool-journal form** in user-facing prose: no `input:/abs/path`, no `tool_step|…` dumps as the citation style.
3. **Disambiguate homonyms**: article / template trees often share short tails (`正文.md`, `04-正文/正文.md`). Cite from project root with unique parents so Host + path map open the right file.
4. **Spaces**: write real spaces in absolute paths (e.g. `Mac Studio…`); never shell-escape `\ `.
5. **Optional line jump**: `` `path/to/file.ts:42` `` or `` `path/to/file.ts:42:10` `` (line / line:col). UI opens the side preview scrolled to that line when possible; external `open_in_editor` gets `-g path:line`. Invalid lines soft-fail (open file, no jump). Parse helpers: `src/lib/pathLineCitation.ts`.

Frontend path map (`sessionPathMap.ts`) collects tool `input:` / last-touched abs paths so short tokens in the same session can still resolve after tools ran — but **user-facing citations should still be unambiguous** without relying on that.

Frontend normalize (`src/lib/pathNormalize.ts` + `src/lib/attachments.ts`):

- Shell-unescape POSIX paths (`file\ \(1\).png` → `file (1).png`)
- Reject site-root absolutes (`/images/…`) for media HTTP
- Fail soft: unresolved relative media → plain code (not broken ImageUi)
- **FilePathCard**: only interactive chrome after Host confirms a real on-disk path (or URL). Unresolved / missing tokens stay plain inline code — never a dead clickable card
- Bare media basenames (`manycore.png`) stay as inline code unless pathMap maps them to a real local abs
- **Plausible local media abs** (`isPlausibleLocalMediaAbs`, host-aligned): POSIX needs ≥2 path segments — never mount VideoUi/ImageUi on `/replica_v2.mp4` mid-path false extracts after space + CJK folder names (`…/grok 美女视频/file.mp4`)
- Bare extract: no mid-path re-match after CJK (unless known root glue `换成/Users/…`); root walk soft-continues through unescaped spaces (`Application Support`, Downloads CJK folders)
- Windows drive + `~/…` media paths stay valid

## Chat attachments (tool → journal → thumb)

| Source | Policy |
|--------|--------|
| Structured tool output (`rawOutput.path`, ChatCut `thumbnail*`) | Attach + **grant** path_scope (may live outside default roots) |
| Freeform text / tool path_hint (reads, ls, markdown) | Attach only if file exists **and** already allowlisted or under session project — no incidental `~/.codex/plugins/...` logos |
| Freeform https in **terminal / file / search tool output** | **Never attach** — command stdout is arbitrary (a `curl` scrape listing image URLs would otherwise become an unrelated chat image card). Gate: `tool_is_media_capable` in `types.rs` |
| Remote `https://` media (ChatCut S3 thumbs, web-research fetches) | Always attach |
| False extracts (`/img_001.png` from `![](media/img_001.png)`) | Never attach; frontend `isDisplayableAttachmentPath` also drops them |

History load calls `paths_classify` (grants existing local paths, drops missing locals) so thumbs do not flash as dead paperclips.

### Remote thumbnail decode bounds

Remote thumbnail responses are read up to 12 MiB plus one overflow sentinel byte,
including chunked bodies with no Content-Length. Before pixel decoding, the Host
checks dimensions (at most 16,384 per edge), total pixels (50 million), and applies
a 256 MiB decoder allocation limit. Valid images retain original dimensions in
metadata and use the existing 480-pixel JPEG thumbnail shape. Local image decoding
and cache behavior are unchanged. The bounded in-memory helper is reusable by
remote wallpaper providers; no network source or new product control is added.
